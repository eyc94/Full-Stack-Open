# More About Styles
- Learned about adding styles to application.
    - First way is in a CSS file.
    - The other was inline.
- We will learn a new way.


## Ready-Made UI Libraries
- Can use ready-made UI frameworks.
- One popular UI library is `Bootstrap` created by Twitter.
- So many UI frameworks now.
- Few different React versions of Bootstrap like `reactstrap` and `react-bootstrap`.
- We will take a look at two UI frameworks.
    - Bootstrap and `MaterialUI`.
- We use both frameworks to add styles to apps we made in `React Router` section.
