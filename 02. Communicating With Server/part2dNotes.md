# Altering Data In Server
- We want to store notes in some backend server when we create notes.
- `json-server` claims to be REST or RESTful API in its documentation:
    - **Get a full fake REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds (seriously)**
    - Does not match textbook definition of REST API, but neither do most that claim so.
    - Important to familiarize ourselves with conventions used by `json-server` and REST APIs in general.
    - We will look at conventional use of `routes`.
        - Known as URLs and HTTP request types.
