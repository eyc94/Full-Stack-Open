# User Administration
- We want to add user authentication and authorization to our app.
- Users are stored in the database.
    - Every note should be linked to the user who created it.
    - Deleting and editing a note should be allowed to the user who created it.
- Add info about users to db.
    - One-to-many relationship between user (`User`) and notes (`Note`).
- In relational db, implementation is straightforward.
    - Both resources have their separate tables.
    - The id of the user who created a note would be stored in the notes table as a foreign key.
- Using document databases is different.
    - Many ways to model the situation.
- Existing solution saves every note in the `notes` collection in db.
    - If we don't want to change this existing solution, natural choice is to save users in their own collection.
    - Like `users`.
- Can use object id in Mongo to reference documents in other collections.
    - Similar to using foreign keys in relational db.
- Document dbs like Mongo don't support `join queries` that are in relational dbs.
    - Used for aggregating data from multiple tables.
    - Starting version 3.2, Mongo supported `lookup aggregation queries`.
        - Not taking a look at this functionality.
- If join queries are needed, we will implement it in our app code by making multiple queries.
    - Mongoose can take care of joining and aggregating data.
        - Gives appearance of join query.
    - Even in these situations, Mongoose makes multiple queries to the database in background.
