# JavaScript

- Name of JavaScript standard is ECMAScript.
    - Latest release is in June 2021 with the name `ECMAScript 2021` or `ES12`.
- Not all latest JS features are supported.
    - Code in browsers has been transpiled from a newer version of JavaScript to an older one.
    - Most popular way to transpile is using `Babel`.
    - Transpilation is automatic with `create-react-app` applications.
- `Node.js` is a JavaScript runtime environment based on Google's `Chrome V8` JavaScript engine.
    - Works anywhere.
- Practice writing JS using Node.
- Code does not need to be transpiled.
- Code written in files ending with `.js`.
    - Run by the command: `$ node name_of_file.js`.

- You can also do this in the dev console.
