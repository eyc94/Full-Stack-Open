# connect
- We have been using our redux-store with help of `hook`-api from `react-redux`.
- This means using `useSelector` and `useDispatch` functions.
- We will look into another older and more complicated way to use redux.
    - The `connect` function provided by `react-redux`.
- **In new apps, use the hook-api**.
    - Knowing how to use connect is useful for maintaining older projects using redux.
