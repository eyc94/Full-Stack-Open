# Login in Frontend
- Last two parts dealt with backend.
- The frontend does not support user management we did to the backend in Part 4.
- The frontend shows existing notes.
    - Lets the user change state of a note from important to not important (and vice versa).
    - New notes cannot be added anymore.
        - Because backend now expects a token verifying user's identity is sent with the new note.
